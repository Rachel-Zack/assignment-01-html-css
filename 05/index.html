            <p>John F. Kennedy (1917-1963) was the President of the United States from 1961 to 1963.<br>
              <br>
              Born in 1917 in Boston, Massachusetts into a wealthy, politically prominent family, Kennedy attended private school in New England, then Harvard University, where he graduated in 1940 with a B.A. in International Affairs. He then joined the United States Navy, serving in the Pacific theater during the Second World War. While stationed there, Kennedy's PT boat was sunk by a Japanese destroyer, and he was awarded a Purple Heart for his heroics in rescuing his crew.<br>
              <br>
              Kennedy was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1946 and the United States Senate in 1952. In 1960, Kennedy ran for President of the United States as a Democrat, defeating Republican Richard Nixon in a close election.<br>
              <br>
              As President, Kennedy dealt with communist influence in Germany, Cuba and Southeast Asia while also addressing racial injustice in the American South. Kennedy's record was mixed: at home, he was slow on civil rights; abroad, he had successes like the Partial Test Ban Treaty alongside failures like the Bay of Pigs. However, the handsome and charismatic Kennedy was well-liked by Americans and the world.<br>
              <br>
              Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas, on November 22, 1963. His death was a traumatic experience for the American people, and has been referred to by both contemporaneous commentators and historians as a "loss of innocence" in the postwar United States.<br>
